# HashNews

This is an Electron-based desktop application that displays news from Twitter based on a particular hashtag. The app is built using TypeScript and ReactJS, making it highly customizable and scalable. Users can search for any hashtag they're interested in and the app will display a real-time feed of tweets containing that hashtag. The application is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with features such as customizable themes and the ability to filter out certain types of tweets (such as retweets or those containing specific words)
